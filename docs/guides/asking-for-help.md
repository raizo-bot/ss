Sometimes you don't know what to do and how to make sense of your code.
These are really simple tips for solution-finding before you ask someone.

These following steps are natural for anyone having programmed for a while, but can be not so straight-forward to any new ducks. These tips are for coding problems but can be applied to pretty much anything. Everyone googles don’t worry.

### Step 1: Try to figure it out yourself

Play around with your code and console to try and pinpoint the root of your issue.

### Step 2. Google it

Unless it was a very simple answer/simply something you forgot, **you should implement the answers you find in a way that you are able to comprehend and not copy an entire code snippet.**

Google your issue, being as precise and succinct as you can. If there is an error message, google part or all of it as well as the language/library you are working with if it’s not clear enough. **For most new coders, the answer will 99%** [\[1\]](https://sirmerr.github.io/freecodecampmontreal-docs/guides/asking_for_help.html#f1) **of the time have already been asked by someone equally confused in various ways**.

Check to see if the tech you’re working with has docs that go along with it that can help you out. Same goes for if this is a company project, sometimes company wide docs go with.

You’re most likely looking for websites with:

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) \(for html/css/javascript\)
* [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) \(**beware, only use this for simple examples and do not take everything on it for granted**\)

### Step 3. Ask for Help

So you tried to solve it on your own, looked through different answers online but you still don’t fully understand. Great! Time to ask for a more custom answer.

Make sure you have **a specific question** to ask and make sure to either:

* post a snippet of the problematic code \([this](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-) can help\)
* point to the lines of your code where the problem lies if necessary \(via GitHub, codepen or equivalent\)
* Use [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) to have an easily runnable version of your code/problem

You can ask on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) , although that can be daunting and it should not be a question that has already asked. You can also ask within the discord’s help channels or ping mentors \(see the specialties of our mentors in the mentors section of the docs\)
