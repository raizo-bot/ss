You will find here documentation for various features of freecodecamp-montreal’s official Discord server.

It’s the place to discuss coding with peers learning how to program or brushing up on their skills, mainly via web development.

The goal is to have dynamic feedback and conversations, as well as facilitate coding questions, peer review and mentoring. It will also serve to help motivate each other to keep growing.

Hopefully it will also make it easier for people to learn best practices, industry standards and have interesting discourse about coding.

## What are the docs about

**TL;DR: Schedules, resources, mentors, upcoming features, best practices, guides, etc.**

Sometimes having a pinned message isn’t enough and important information gets lost in the crowd.

As the discord grows, more docs will be added on a need-to-know basis and you can refer to these docs whenever. Even though it will touch a few features \(mentors, coding session schedules, etc.\) which are only available to the freecodecamp-montreal discord, the goal is to have resources that anyone can use.

This means that there will be some simple stuff too, that most professional developers already know about, but can be an ahah! moment for others.
