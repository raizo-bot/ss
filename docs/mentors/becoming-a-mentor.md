# Becoming a Mentor

## Why should I become one?

Maybe you like helping budding developers, want to better talk in layman terms or maybe you want a shiny discord label.

The goal here is for you to serve as a guide to people who need the extra help, or someone people know they can trust to ask what tech stack they should be learning next. People should not be spamming you, it should be mostly casual unless you want it to be more.

## Perks :D?

* A shiny new label
* Representation in Our Mentors section
* First dibs on stickers and small trinkets of appreciation
* The ability to host your own workshops \(coming soon\)

## Do I qualify?

You should have

* Languages/techs which you are very comfortable with.
* Patience/Willingness to explain concepts to people of different levels.

You do not need to be a master of everything and knowing when to defer is important.

## How do I apply!

DM a **@Firestarter** in Discord with

1.  What you would be willing to mentor \(usually languages\)
2.  A small relevant history
3.  Proof of capability if possible \(GitHub, etc.\)

Someone will look over your portfolio and most likely talk to you.
